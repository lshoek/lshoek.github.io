### Augmented Blueware
#### 2018

When employed at TWNKLS | augmented reality (later acquired by PTC AR), I built a mobile application for Royal Delft and FLEX/design.

"The Dutch Design Award jury rewards ‘Augmented Blueware’ with a Dutch Design Award 2018. They praise the close cooperation of the three partners Royal Delft, TWNKLS | augmented reality and FLEX/design. This resulted in the development of a unique concept; Augmented Blueware, an exclusive tableware, with the decorations of a unique hand-painted Delft Blue vase.
