### And so on, and so forth
#### Lesley van Hoek, Max Peeperkorn & Marissa Memelink, 2020

With a practice rooted in both art and science, Lesley van Hoek, Max Peeperkorn, and Marissa Memelink collaborate on projects using technologies to explore concepts flowing from human cognition, such as consciousness, imagination, and creativity.

And so on, and so forth is an installation exploring the cognitive process of analogy-making through digital technology. Based on previously recorded scenes of the room, the installation continuously interprets its current environment and learns with every observation. Both the output and the technological process of the work are an attempt to illustrate these similar underlying mechanisms of our mind.
