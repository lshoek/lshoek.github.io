### Shush: an interactive sound art-installation
#### 2019

Shush is an interactive sound installation in which a single participant is placed in an artificial auditory environment that resembles a noisy classroom. The sounds in this space travel around with varying behaviors and can be perceived as either pleasant or obnoxious. The participant is able to silence particular sounds by shouting or shushing in the general direction they are coming from. However, new sounds will emerge over time. The participant can decide to attempt to achieve complete silence, leave the desired sounds in the space or to allow for complete chaos.

Software: Processing, Pure Data, Arduino
