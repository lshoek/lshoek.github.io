### Coded Nature II: Vortex
#### Studio DRIFT, 2024

"Coded Nature explores the relationship between humans, nature and technology. Autonomous vortices of DRIFT blocks responds to the movement of the audience, reflecting the endless opportunities of creation in nature as well as a continuous flow of change. The work was unveiled at Art Basel Paris 2024." - Studio DRIFT

My contribution to this work was the design and implementation of a real-time GPU-accelerated 3D wind simulation that can be manipulated through user-interaction (all C++/Vulkan/GLSL).
