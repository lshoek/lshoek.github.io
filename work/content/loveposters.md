### Love Posters live visuals
#### 2023

A modest utility for real-time audioreactive poster-like visuals. A little pet project of mine.  

As co-host of Rotterdam-based intimate underground disco club night Love Transmission, I also created a program that procedurally generates colorful visuals that respond to live audio at the party. The software is open-source and some evolution of it has been on view at almost every edition of Love Transmission so far. The project also spawned a NAP FFT module that is now part of the NAP core.

In 2025, inspired by Love Transmission's visuals, Arp Frique commissioned me to create a sampler video for his album "The Gospel of Jesamy". The final result was captured using the Love Posters app and features animations by [Andrew Colin Beck](https://www.andrewcolinbeck.com/).
