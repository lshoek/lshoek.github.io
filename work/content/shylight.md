### Shylight & Shy Society
#### Studio DRIFT, 2020

Studio DRIFT commissioned NAP Labs to design a completely new control, sequence, and pre-visualization environment for the kinetic installation Shylight.

The system created for Shylight gives direct, real-time control over hundreds of Shylights simultaneously. The choreography is accurately pre-visualized in 3D, giving the artist the option to configure and design a complete show in advance, without the physical installation present.

The app, built with NAP Framework, uses a sequencer to animate Shylight's light intensity and position, and is able to do real-time sequencing with audiosync, blending procedural effects, like waves, into the sequence and has a 3D pre-visualizer for accurate simulation of Shylights in the scene.

Real-time communication with Shylight is done through Ethercat, an industrial protocol with extreme timing precision and requirements, which provides direct control over Beckhoff subdevices, including LED and Servo terminals. All subdevices are synchronized to the same reference clock and controlled at 500 to 1000Hz.
