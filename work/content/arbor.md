### Arbor
#### Vincent Rang, 2023

The arbor application is a visual art instrument for generating and visualizing procedural tree structures. It uses a custom aggregate growth model to simulate a treeâ€™s course of life, starting from a tiny sapling up to a large fully grown tree. The ruleset that influences the shape and size of the tree can be configured in preparation for a live performance. A large set of parameters that control both the growth and visualization can be changed live and mapped to a supported MIDI controller.
