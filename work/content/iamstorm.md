### I Am Storm
#### Studio DRIFT, 2022

Studio DRIFT commissioned NAP Labs to design a real-time control and pre-visualization application for their work I Am Storm.

"I Am Storm is an immersive artwork which represents the gusts of wind in a field of grass. Rooted in DRIFTâ€™s fascination with the mesmerising rhythms of nature, this artwork draws on the essence of wind. The majority of plant species are dependent on this power: without wind there would be no waves, pollination or rain. Nothing on this planet would move." - Studio DRIFT

As software engineer on the project at NAP Labs, I built a real-time 3D pre-visualization environment featuring a wind simulation that could be manipulated to produce organic flow fields. The simulation informed the movements and colors of the light modules.
