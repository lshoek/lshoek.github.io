### Koraalreef Live Visuals
[Koraalreef](https://www.facebook.com/koraalreef) is a coral-themed club party concept I host with some friends. We have organized three successful editions so far--the last of which was in Filmcafe Utrecht with over 150 visitors. The party features a large projection with unique real-time audio-reactive visuals. I wrote custom software to repurpose the artworks and animations in interesting ways that fit the theme and atmosphere. All content is instantiated and cycled randomly so that every frame is unique the entire night.

All software was built using C++/openFrameworks/OpenGL/GLSL.
