						<h3>Artefacts of Verisimilitudes</h3>
<h4>Lesley van Hoek &amp; Marissa Memelink, 2019</h4>
<p>In collaboration with Marissa Memelink.</p>
<p>Our memories of events we experienced in our dreams trickle down into our waking life. These false memories pollute our perception of reality, like residues of a different world that are manifesting themselves in our here and now, blurring a conscious and unconscious state. What if these two could be experienced simultaneously?</p>
<p>Our work provides a window into an anti-world, where these false memories still exist. The participant can look “through” the panels into the room. A digital representation of the space owes its appearance to the limited technical capabilities of a 3D scanner (Kinect v1). The participant is encouraged to move around and seek the boundaries of this representation.</p>
<p>Through head tracking (Kinect v2) the real-world perspective of the participant is mapped seamlessly to the digital world, as if an augmented veil of a fake reality overlays the room and reveals its counter-identity. This way, the Kinect functions as a hypothetical eye to the participants’ unconsciousness, with which they can consciously look at ‘their’ memory of the room -- as if they would have visited the current space in the past.</p>
<p>The lossy quality of the scan --morphing the structures of the objects in space-- and its frayed-end boundaries create a dream-like environment. This experience is enhanced by hallucinating visual effects that strike at random, reminding you of the fact that it is all fake.</p>
<p>The panels this way display artefacts of ‘what is not really here’, as windows to an anti-reality of unstable memories, which exists parallel to the world as we perceive it.</p>
